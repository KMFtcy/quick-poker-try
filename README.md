# quick-poker-try

A simple Texas Poker game. Develop it for nodejs learning.

## Game page

For simplicity, I develop a pure HTML/CSS/JS game front page.

To open the front page, you can use any HTTP server to provide access to the game for players. A simple example is start a http server under root by using node module with following command:

```
npx http-server ./game-page -p 8000
```

Then, open the page in the browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/game.html
```
